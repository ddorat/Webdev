<p>Hello, my name is Dania Dorat. I am a Technical Communication major, and I am also taking two minors in interactive design and writing. I enjoy reading, writing, and watching tv. I am currently working on a fairytale retelling book that wishes to self-publish one day. Some of my future goals are to start looking into internships for the spring/summer as well as be more proactive using my UX skills. I don’t really know where I want to go with my technical writing skill due to the fact that I haven’t had a lot of real-world experience, which is why I’m excited to learn more about the different internships at KSU. Being able to use the skill that I learn in class in an actual work environment helps me remember the information better. </p>


<p>In this web development class, I am looking forward to learning the basic foundation of HTML coding language and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language. HTML is the standard markup language for documents design that can be displayed in a web browser that can also be assisted with CSS. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to user on styled, laid out, etc. </p>

<p>In this class I would like to learn how to structure a website using HTML and CSS. I want to understand all the different element that help make up different part of the content in a website using tags. Once I understand the basic principle, I would love to incorporate different design that can make my website aesthetically pleasing to the viewer eye. </p>
